This repository contains problem sets I solved from the course "CS50's introduction to Computer Science using C" by Harvard University.This involved completing lectures from each week and then solving problem sets from the corresponding week.In addition to C, the course also gave an overview to Python, SQL,web development  and cybersecurity 

 Week 1: C
Focused on learning C, one of the most foundational programming languages. Topics covered included data types, variables, loops, functions, and conditionals. The week emphasized building simple command-line programs and understanding how computers process instructions.

Week 2: Arrays
Covered the concept of arrays in C, learning how to store and manipulate data collections efficiently. The course introduced multi-dimensional arrays and how they are used to store complex data structures, as well as basic memory management techniques.

Week 3: Algorithms
Implemented and optimized various algorithms including searching (binary search) and sorting (bubble sort, selection sort). This week emphasized understanding algorithmic complexity, particularly in terms of time and space complexity.

Week 4: Memory
Introduced the concept of memory management in C, focusing on pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and freeing memory. Learned to allocate memory at runtime and to understand how memory is handled during program execution.

Week 5: Data Structures
Implemented key data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues. The focus was on understanding their practical applications and how they can be used to solve various problems involving dynamic data manipulation and memory management.

Week 6: Python
Transitioned to learning Python, a high-level language known for its readability. The topics covered included Python syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries), and functions. 

Week 7: SQL
Covered the basics of SQL and relational databases, including how to create and manage tables, insert data, and query databases. The week focused on writing SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation, along with database normalization.

Week 8: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Focused on web development. Learned to structure web pages using HTML, style them with CSS, and add interactivity through JavaScript. Topics included DOM manipulation, event handling, and building responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes.
